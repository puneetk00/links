Hi Juan, Thank you for accepting my connection request. This is Ankit from SynapseIndia. I was going through your profile and found you are taking care of Apparel & Fashion Industry at Icon Apparel Group LLC as President. I wanted to make a few suggestions for design and development an e-commerce website for your business “Icon Apparel Group LLC”. We can provide you a website that will be good looking, mobile friendly and user friendly as well. It would be a fully functional e-commerce website wherein users would be able to view the listing/catalog of the products, pricing of the products, users would be able to place orders, can pay online, select shipping option, etc. You as an admin will be able to manage the products inventory, orders, etc. There will be multi-tier pricing structure for retail vs wholesale customers. We will also integrate blogging functionality into the website. Having a blog page would help in revealing the details of the store and its products and it will also assist in managing the ranking of the store in Google. It’s great way of building audience and generating more traffic and sales for the business. We will also develop login, registration and account setup for the users. We would also integrate CRM, email marketing platform and ERP/Accounting platform as per your choice. Listed below are some of the e-commerce websites we have designed and developed earlier for apparel & fashion businesses for your perusal: https://www.stevemadden.com/https://komarov.com/https://www.banjoandmatilda.com https://www.missiclothing.com http://originalretrobrand.com/  For more information you can visit our company website https://www.synapseindia.com . I am sure, you will get a better understanding of how we could considerably benefit your business and online presence. We are an ISO 9001:2015 certified company which ensures sustained customer satisfaction by producing, delivering services and providing support functions that meet customer's needs and expectations. We are also a Microsoft Gold Partner and our processes have been audited by an independent body to ensure that the development processes we follow are matching the best in the industry and ensure maximum quality and efficiency. Please let me know your feedback so we can discuss further accordingly on the next steps. Looking forward to hearing from you.  Regards,Ankit Kumar__________________________SynapseIndiahttp://www.synapseindia.comI.T.
